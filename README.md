#  Basic Python Projects
This repository  contains some basic projects written in Python that I learned in my Python course. I got to learn how to use various modules like Tkinter and Sqlite3.

## Projects:
* Phonebook
* Check Files Gui
* Django 

## Phonebook
This project uses a Python function that creates a phonebook for the user. The function allows users to enter and save contacts' names, phone numbers, and email addresses in a database. It also allows the user to update and delete data.

## Check Files Gui
"The Check Files Gui project allows the user to choose to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. 
All files that  are moved will be saved in a database".

## Django
For this project, I learned how to use the Django framework and how to create a dynamic website.
